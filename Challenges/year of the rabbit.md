YEAR OF THE RABBIT

Let's have a nice gentle start to the New Year!
Can you hack into the Year of the Rabbit box without falling down a hole?

I will not lie to you but this challenge was quite challenging couple up with the fact that netowrk was messing with me

I started this challenge with nmap and gobuster which gave me promising results.

nmap gave me open ports, ftp, ssh, http

The gobuster result gave me a directory /assets which in its own gave me a step toward completion. The directory had two files, RickRolled.mp4 and style.css. The video called my attention, so went for it and was surprised to see a video I just watched from someone's whatsapp status not long ago.
