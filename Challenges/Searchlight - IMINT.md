# Searchlight - IMINT

This is an simple OSINT challenge where I was was given over 8 task too complete. Now, if it comes to the work to be put into this, I would say it's a good challenge for beginners and would no give you much challenge like a room called Sakura (I was wondering who created that room and called it tagged it easy ğŸ˜•)

Now, the first task is simple. You are to identify the street which from the picture, its already written on the sign 
What is the name of the street where this image was taken?

> Carnaby street
