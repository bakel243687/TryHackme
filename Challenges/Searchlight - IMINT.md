# Searchlight - IMINT

This is an simple OSINT challenge where I was was given over 9 task too complete. Now, if it comes to the work to be put into this, I would say it's a good challenge for beginners and would no give you much challenge like a room called Sakura (I was wondering who created that room and called it tagged it easy ðŸ˜•)

## Task 1
Do you understand the flag format. Read through the intro and you would get how you should submit your answer as a flag
> sl{ready}

## Task 2
Now, the second task is simple. You are to identify the street which from the picture, its already written on the sign

What is the name of the street where this image was taken?

> Carnaby street

## Task 3
Just Google it!: This is a relatively simple task but with google and the right key word, you would find the answers to following questions

When we google the image by inputting it into the search engine, we would be able to tell the location is name and the city. As far as we know the location and the name of the place, we would be able to find more information for the place.

Which city is the tube station located in?
> London

I wouldn't answer the remaining question as you should be able to answer the rest by following the guide I just gave.

## Task 4
Keep at it!: In OSINT, we need to be vigilant and take note of the slightest details and the most obvious ones too.

All detail in the image has it's story to tell, at least. Browsing what is written on the banner at the end of the room, we would get many information we would need to verify. I was able to verify this when I saw the name on the banner as the url of the comapnies website.

You could also dump the image into google search engine and see the cross referencing of the image give you the name of the building, location and various images alike

> The Vancouver International Airport

## Task 5
Coffee and a light lunch: This task needs the us of maps. It was an interesting one as I had to google the name of the building in the photo and find the exact one. I could actually make it easier for myself and use the google image search but nah, I don't need that now. I took the long route and found the Edinburgh Woollen Mill in Scotland.

Using google map, I checked the location of the coffee shop and identified the name of the coffee shop which is what I would use to Find info on the business owner of The Wee coffee shop on Allan street

Which city is this coffee shop located in?
> Blaigowrie

## Task 6

Reverse your thinking: This was actually easy as I just put the image into the google image search, though there are other options of tools to use for this, I am more familiar with our dear Google. Got the name of the restaurant in the image

Which restaurant was this picture taken at?
> katz's deli

Quite a place we got there. You can go a look up the place and why it's interesting.haaaaaaa, like just look at the menu. *Salivates

## Task 7

Locate the sculpture; This task is nice and stressful as it took me time to find the person that took this image of the sculpture. It's easy to get the name of the sculpture by just browsing the image, but that of the photographer? Nahhh



I went thorugh a lot, I wouldn't lie to you. And I also saw many walk-through on this stuff, but I must find it and I did. On a website called Visit Oslo. I used the map there and searched up the sculputre, lo and behold, I got his name 


## Task 8

![image alt](https://github.com/bakel243687/TryHackme/blob/cda5d39afeafdf3f710d8d987947c08114da6e29/Challenges/Images/task8_1603365958159.png)

.....and justice for all: Why are there different variations of Lady justice? Well, I don't know why but after putting the image into search, I got the exact image and the location with a news on which gave me the exact location of the court house and the name

## Task 9
The view from my hotel room: this one gave me headache as navigating the street on google map is quite tough and requires control. I was able to identify buildings in the surrounding and the take note of the environment. With that, when I used google map 360 feature to navigate the place, with perspective and my precise uncalculated calculation in my head, I was able identify the hotel.
